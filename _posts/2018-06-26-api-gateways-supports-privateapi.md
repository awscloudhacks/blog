You can now create Private APIs in Amazon API Gateway. Private APIs can only be accessed from within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using VPC Endpoints. 

Using Private APIs, you can choose to restrict API traffic to stay within your Amazon VPC which can be isolated from the public internet. Private APIs also enable you to securely expose REST APIs to resources only within your VPC or to those connected to your data centers via AWS Direct Connect. You can also restrict access to selected Amazon VPCs and VPC Endpoints as well as enable cross account access using Resource Policies.
