You can use AWS Secrets Manager to rotate, manage, and retrieve secrets such as database credentials and API keys throughout their lifecycle. And you can now use these secrets across AWS accounts by attaching resource-based policies to secrets. For example, you can manage secrets in one AWS account and grant employees or applications in other AWS accounts permissions to use these secrets. 

Similarly, you can share a secret with a business partner, such as a managed service provider (MSP), without transmitting the secret through channels such as email and handwritten notes. Resource-based policies also enable you to control who can manage permissions on a secret. For example, you can grant an employee permission to administer a specific secret.
